// overview of the Standard Template Library (STL)
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

// The Standard Template Library is part of the ANSI ISO C++ Standard,
// so it's guaranteed to be part of every C++ development system.
// The Standard Template Library, commonly called the STL,
// provides containers, and supporting data types
// like vectors, lists, queues and iterators.
// Other basic functions are provided by the C++ standard library.
// The STL provides a number of standard containers, iterators and algorithms.
// Some of these include,
// -- vector -- STL
// The vector, a fundamental, random access container
// that can be used in many places a C Array can be used,
// but with a lot more functionality.
// -- list -- STL
// The list, a double-linked list optimized for
// rapid inserts and deletes.
// -- set -- STL
// A set, which is an ordered sequence container,
// where elements are kept in a strict order
// based on their value.
// -- map -- STL
// Map is an associative container,
// where unique keys are used to
// access associated values.
// -- stack, queue, deque -- STL
// Stack, queue and deque are LIFO, FIFO,
// and double-ended containers for
// pushing and popping data from a stack.
// -- string -- STL
// String is a specialized container
// of characters optimized for use as strings.
// -- I/O -- STL
// I/O Streams read and write data
// to and from files and I/O devices.
//
// It's worth noting that we used "cout"
// for most of the console output.
// cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
// We haven't beem using "cout" in other chapters
// because outside the context of the STL,
// "cout" is not efficient and
// I don't tend to use it myself without the STL.
// "cout" is designed to work with STL classes,
// and I do use it when I'm using the STL.
// And we use it extensively in this chapter.
// "cout" is based on the I/O Stream classes.

// The STL is very large.
// Understanding the C++ Standard Template Library
// is an essential part of becoming a competent C++ programmer.
// The STL is part of the C++ standard, and it provides
// a great deal of basic functionality for C++ programmers.
