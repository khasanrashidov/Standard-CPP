// In this course, my goal was to gain
// a good working knowledge of C++.
// I've covered the basic syntax of the language,
// along with its operators and data types,
// and how to create my own functions,
// classes, and templates.
// I've learned how to use and understand
// the powerful standard template library,
// one of the most flexible and powerful
// container libraries available in any language.
// Along the way, I am sure I've taken some time to
// experiment with exercise files and create
// some of my own classes for use in my own projects.
// C++ is a tremendously powerful language,
// and while I've covered the essentials in this course,
// it's not substitute for experience.
// I need to write (encourage others as well) 
// a lot of my own code and continue learning
// from my own experiences with this
// remarkable language. 
// I've enjoyed this course, so I need to have fun
// and create something wonderful in C++.
